# Profiling Code with the Time Module

The `Profiler` class in the Time module is a powerful tool for measuring the execution time of code. It is particularly useful for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing real-time applications.

This tutorial walks you through the key features of the `Profiler` class and explains the examples provided in the `profiling_code.py` example script.

## Key Features of the Profiler

The `Profiler` class supports three main usage patterns:

1. **Tic-Toc Timing**: Measure the duration of specific code blocks that are wrapped in `Tic()` and `Toc()` commands.
2. **Expression Profiling**: Profile the execution time of an expression by passing it to the profiler wrapped in a lambda function.
3. **Decorator**: Automatically profile a function by decorating it.

## Example 1: Tic-Toc Timing

The `tic` and `toc` methods allow you to measure the duration of specific code blocks.

```python
--8<-- "tutorials/time/profiling_code.py:8:12"
```

### Explanation

- `tic()`: Starts the timer.
- `toc()`: Stops the timer and returns the elapsed time.
- This pattern is useful for profiling specific sections of code.

## Example 2: Profiling an Expression with a Lambda

The `profile` method allows you to measure the execution time of an expression or a small block of code by passing it as a lambda function.

```python
--8<-- "tutorials/time/profiling_code.py:35:39"
```

### Explanation

- `profile(func)`: Measures the execution time of the provided function or expression.
- `N`: The number of times the profiler has been used.
- `agg`: The total time spent in all profiled expressions.

This pattern is particularly useful for profiling small, self-contained expressions or blocks of code without needing to define a separate function. For example, you can use it to measure the time taken by a single line of code or a quick computation.

## Example 3: Using the Profiler as a Decorator

The `decorate` method allows you to profile a function by simply adding a decorator.

```python
--8<-- "tutorials/time/profiling_code.py:19:28"
```

### Explanation

- `@profiler.decorate`: Automatically profiles the decorated function.
- This pattern is useful for profiling functions without modifying their code.

## Summary

The `Profiler` class provides flexible tools for measuring execution time in real-time applications. Whether you need to profile specific code blocks, repeated function calls, or entire functions, the `Profiler` class has you covered.
