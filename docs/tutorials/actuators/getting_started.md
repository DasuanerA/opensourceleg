# Getting Started

This tutorial section is designed to help you get started with the `opensourceleg.actuators` module.

## Prerequisites for all `actuators` tutorials

- Raspberry Pi
- Python environment with `opensourceleg` package installed

For most of the tutorials, we will be using the Dephy Actuator as an example but you can use any other supported actuator and please swap the actuator initialization code with the one for the actuator you are using.
